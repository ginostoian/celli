                        The minimalist style is defined by an airy ambiance which you can get by using high quality
                        materials with clean lines, simplicity,
                        elegant aesthetics and a neutral color pallete. When considering your minimalist kitchen layout,
                        you should have in mind innovative storage and multi functional funrniture that fits your
                        lifestyle requirements. Avoiding complicated and fussy designs is smartest way to make your
                        minimalist kitchen look its best.

                        kitchen and dining room creating an open plan kitchen. This can transform a cramped dark room in
                        a big, open and enjoyable place to entertain and amaze your family and friends.

                        cooking. Having a kitchen in an extension enables the space to be a place for living, dining,
                        socializing and even doing homework with your little ones.
