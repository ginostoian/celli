            <h3 class="article-subtitle">Tips on what to look after when hiring a bathroom contractor</h3>
            <p>
                It might not seem like it but the bathroom is one of the most important rooms in your home. Think about
                it.
                It's the
                place where you get ready, where you clean yourself and where you "meditate"..cough!
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of its importance to the whole family, the bathroom should not only look pretty but also be
                functional.
            </p>

            <div class="article-highlight">Did you know that a refurbished bathroom increases the sell value of a
                house?</div>

            <p>
                For the above reasons, some people are renovating their bathrooms every 5 years or so. Others only
                renovate
                when their
                budgets allow them to do so.
            </p>

            <p>
                Either way, renovating a bathroom is not an easy task. It is a costly endeavour that will require your
                attention if you
                wish to get the best results.
            </p>

            <p>
                Choosing the right contractor for your bathroom refurbishment project is crucial as they will be the
                people
                in charge of
                making your dream bathroom come true. The more experience they have, the fewer problems will occur
                during
                the project
                and this will make the process much easier for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below we will list some things you should keep in mind when you are hiring a company to manage your
                bathroom
                renovation
                project.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-subtitle">1. Check the contractors' experience</h3>

            <p>
                In building, experience is very important and is what sets contractors apart. A company or a sole trader
                that has
                completed 50 bathroom renovations will be much better at spotting potential problems with the project in
                advance, than
                someone who has worked and completed 3 projects. The more experienced the contractor the more advice he
                can
                offer you
                when making important decisions like e.g. 'what type of paint to use', 'problems with layout changes',
                'water pressure
                problems that may arise when changing bathroom fittings'.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best way to check a contractor's experience is by looking over their online presence. They will
                usually
                have
                different profiles and accounts with reviews that showcase the projects that they worked on. If the
                contractor worked
                with someone you know, even better, ask that person about the experience they've had with them.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-subtitle">2. Read the quote thoroughly</h3>

            <p>
                The company that you are planning to hire should always send you a written proposal usually called a
                quote.
                This should
                have their details, the date the quote has been written, the services that are being quoted and their
                respective prices
                and what else is included in the price.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is very important to read the quote carefully and understand exactly what you are paying for as this
                is
                usually where
                you could end up getting burned.
            </p>

            <p>
                The quotes provided by Celli Design & Build state exactly the materials that are included in the price,
                the
                materials
                that the client is expected to purchase, the price for each service and the total of the services plus
                the
                VAT. We also
                have a disclaimer for the client that any service required that is not present in the quote will have to
                be
                priced
                separately.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-subtitle">3. The quote should not cost</h3>

            <p>
                There are some situations where companies go the extra mile when quoting and offer the client 3D renders
                and
                whatnot and
                that quote will cost you upfront, which I think is fair.
            </p>

            <p>
                You should raise an eyebrow when a company or sole trader tries to charge you for a simple, normal
            <p>
                At Celli Design & Build we try and make the quoting process as easy as possible for the client. With
                this in
                mind we
                offer a couple of options to get your bathroom refurbishment quote:
                - on-site visit with an estimator
                - zoom or facetime call with an estimator
                - easy and quick online bathroom quotation form
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-subtitle">4. Check their availability</h3>

            <p>
                Sometimes companies are booked for months even though they are quoting for new projects. Always discuss
                when
                you would
                like to start your bathroom renovation to check if they have teams available for that period.
            </p>

            <p>
                Connected to this is that you should always ask your contractor to estimate the time it will take them
                to
                complete the
                project. The answer to this question will let you know if the contractor knows what he's doing or not.
            </p>

            <p>
                A bathroom renovation usually takes between 10 and 16 days to complete depending on the difficulty. If
                you
                have someone
                telling you that they will complete your bathroom in 3 days, that is a massive red flag.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-subtitle">5. Always ask your contractor if they offer any guarantee</h3>

            <div class="article-highlight">Guarantees are very important especially when talking about bathroom
                refurbishments.</div>

            <p>
                A lot of the time things do go wrong especially over time. A leak can appear at some point, grouting can
                wear off,
                silicone might need to be reapplied etc. If these problems appear due to the workmanship of the
                contractor
                he should be
                liable to come and fix them free of charge for some time after the project has been completed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Celli Design & Build offers a 2-year Bathroom Fitting guarantee to every client. This means that any
            <p>
                If the contractor passes all the above tests, you most likely found one of the few good ones and your
                bathroom
                renovation project will be swift and painless.
